title: Time
---

I often find myself wondering why I'm wondering why I'm existing in this exact moment; What prevents me from being
suddenly aware in another moment? Why this moment in particular?

If time is simply another dimension, then any given point in it would hold no more significance than any other. So why
am I in this exact moment and not the next? Why am I here, at 8:21, instead of somewhere displaced by a year?

My presence at any given time is mere coincidence: there's no particular reason that anything should happen at any given
time as compared to any other.

A concept within computer simulations[^1] is that of a tick, or the smallest unit of time that passes each frame. Many
or most simulations
operate on this principle: Once every tick, move closer to the enemy. Once every tick, apply velocity. Once every tick,
check for player input.\
But one can simply change the amount of ticks that have passed; One can simply move the simulation in time.

From this concept I find no reason why I am present in any given time and not the next. Why now? Why can't I be present
in a time when I've finished all of my homework? Do I exist in all times concurrently?
