Thought is not the most healthy thing. It's like oxygen, sugar, or oil: sweet and constant, yet slowly deadly. To be able to analyze the world around oneself with the scrutiny of an eagle seems almost at odds with complacency, but are people who do not ponder really missing out on anything?

Whenever I consider Christians, I arrive at the conclusion that although they have little evidence or grounded argument to support their claims about whatever they believe (typically their claims require a belief in the bible or some other thing), they seem to be quite happy in their ignorance, which leads me to believe that ignorance is to them inadvertently a virtue. Would it not be more fun or pleasing to believe, even baselessly, that life continues after death or that the spirit exists separate from the body?

Even while I hate thought, I think. I tie myself in loops for thoughts I consider irrational, then fight back with thought against my thouhgt for beating myself up over irrational thought. I think about how to stop myself from thinking and I dash myself against mind stones. I consider morality and determine that all must be treated as I am, but I simply cannot empathize with everyone.
