I'm going back to school today. I've accomplished only half of my aims, but that's alright;
There's always next time.

School starts tomorrow, and I'll finally be able to learn trigonometry.
I've been trying to every semester since I first happened upon something like this:

```java
double length = 10;
double angle = Math.atan2(currentY - otherY, currentX - otherX);
double x = Math.cos(angle) * length;
double y = Math.sin(angle) * length;
```
I was probably attempting to make a Minecraft plugin do something
This intersection between math and *[cs]: Computer Science
fascinates me for some odd reason.
It's probably the precision and reliability with which this intersection functions that provides this fascination

The articulated robots in the Cit√© des Sciences et de l'Industrie provide a good example of this.
All day they move letters around their box, dodging each other and placing the letters precisely where they need to be.
If these robots weren't hyper-precise, their slight mistakes would snowball into collisions with the letters and each other.

Despite its more simplistic and childish connotations, the robot that my competitive robotics team makes uses similar mathematics to move around, and it does so with great, if not perfect, precision.[^1]\
In the situations where the competition robot fails to completely, the error is typically a result of loss of traction or loss of contact with the ground.
Furthermore, these errors are more than likely caused by mechanical issues as opposed to software issues.
