I've just finished week 1 of my second semester, and it was comparatively chill. I haven't missed any assignments,
I've joined the tennis team, and I've only forgotten 4 things already[^1]. Because all of my classes were yearlongish,
I've kept all but one of the same teachers. Fortunately, the teacher of whom I was not a large fan is the one replaced.

I'm taking:
1. AP Biology
2. AP US History
3. Dual Credit English
4. Honors Precalculus
5. Honors Chemistry
6. Latin 1 CP

Most of these are gen eds I have to take to graduate, but that doesn't prevent me from enjoying some of them.
Here are my ratings:

| Class     | Rating                       | Reasoning                                                                                         |
|-----------|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| APUSH     | Fun, but sometimes demanding | The class is mostly listening to the teacher talk, with some assignments here and there.          |
| AP Bio    | Boring                       | The teacher has taught the same class 3.25 times in a row.                                        |
| Precal    | Interesting                  | I enjoy learning trigonometry, but sometimes this class is ready to shank me.                     |
| English   | Difficult, but Intriguing    | The class teaches one to think in interesting ways, but I have difficulty completing assignments. |
| Chemistry | Easy                         | The teacher of this class dedicates a lot of time to practicing and review.                       |
| Latin     | Deceptively easy             | My grade in this class is always about to dip down to a 66 for no reason at all.                  |

Because tables are fun, here's another one. This time it's what we're learning in class.

| Class     | What we're learning                    |
|-----------|----------------------------------------|
| APUSH     | Rockefeller and Carnegie               |
| AP Bio    | Gregor Mendel                          |
| Precal    | Triangle definitions of trig functions |
| English   | Poems                                  |
| Chemistry | Reactions                              |
| Latin     | Vesuvius and Intransitive verbs        |

Goodbye.
