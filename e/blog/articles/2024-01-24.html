    <p>People are always amazed at the fact that I was homeschooled for 12 years.
When I told an LPC that, he flinched.
Homeschooling has definitely impacted the way I think in both positive and negative ways. For example, I've come to
enjoy learning, which, with exceptions, is potentially a rare find among individuals educated in the school system.
In opposition of this optimistic thought is the idea that I am socially inept when compared with the same individuals.
I was never really surrounded with people my age at the age where that mattered. As I grew older, up until the time I
finally did go to school, I began to socialize with other people my age less and less. I justified my friendlessness
with the idea that I was somehow superior to my nonexistent peers, even while I was falling behind in social aptitude.
When I couldn't suitably find myself superior to others, I engaged in useless tasks to make myself feel superior. If I
found someone superior to me, I would find something that I could do that they could not, and use that to give myself
the mental upper hand. <br />
I finally did go to school, and there I noticed the fallacy in my superiority complex and the reality of my ineptitude.</p>
<p>So while homeschooling is good for education, it requires supplements (homeschool co-ops, sports teams) in order to
successfully provide sufficient social exercise to its pupils.</p>
