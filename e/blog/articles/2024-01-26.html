    <p>I often find myself wondering why I'm wondering why I'm existing in this exact moment; What prevents me from being
suddenly aware in another moment? Why this moment in particular?</p>
<p>If time is simply another dimension, then any given point in it would hold no more significance than any other. So why
am I in this exact moment and not the next? Why am I here, at 8:21, instead of somewhere displaced by a year?</p>
<p>My presence at any given time is mere coincidence: there's no particular reason that anything should happen at any given
time as compared to any other.</p>
<p>A concept within computer simulations<sup><a id='note-1-ref' href='#note-1' class='footnote'>1</a></sup> is that of a tick, or the smallest unit of time that passes each frame. Many
or most simulations
operate on this principle: Once every tick, move closer to the enemy. Once every tick, apply velocity. Once every tick,
check for player input.<br />
But one can simply change the amount of ticks that have passed; One can simply move the simulation in time.</p>
<p>From this concept I find no reason why I am present in any given time and not the next. Why now? Why can't I be present
in a time when I've finished all of my homework? Do I exist in all times concurrently?</p>
<p><div class='footnote'><sup><a id='note-1' href='#note-1-ref' class='footnote'>1</a></sup>To clarify, I'm not suggesting that we're living in a simulation.</p></div>
